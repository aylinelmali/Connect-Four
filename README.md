# Connect-Four
For the Connect Four game, when you start it prompts you to choose whether the player or computer goes first 
(X always goes first).
If the computer goes first it will always pick column D first.
The AI focuses mainly on blocking every move of the player, so it is tricky to beat.
Every time there is a new move the program will print out the board.
If the player wins, the program lists all the moves of the player.
If the computer wins, the program lists all the moves of the computer.
If the board fills and there is a tie, the program lists the moves of both the player and the computer.
When choosing a column, if your answer is invalid it will prompt you to answer again.
If you enter a column but that column is full, it will prompt you to answer again.
If you wish to exit the game type "Q" when prompted.
